# AppRun - Server Side Rendering

[AppRun](https://github.com/yysun/apprun) is isomorphic/universal. AppRun components can render on the client-side, as well as on the server-side using the AppRun server-side view engine.

In this SSR AppRun application example, there are:

* The express.js server application (server.ts),
* The AppRun main program (components/main.tsx),
*	The AppRun components (components/*.tsx)
* The client-side application (/public/spa.js).


You can run the application on @glitch, [https://apprun-ssr.glitch.me](https://apprun-ssr.glitch.me/)

To develop and build the application

* Use _npm start_ to start the server
* Use _npm run build_ to build for production

Have fun.
